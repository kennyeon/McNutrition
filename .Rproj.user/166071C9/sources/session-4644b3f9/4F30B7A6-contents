Developed a dashboard app using R studio that visualizes either nutritional information about a McDonaldâ€™s menu item or how much of the recommended daily value the item fulfills depending on what the user would like to see.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this dashboard app came from the desire to make it easier for people to understand what they are eating and its nutritional value. Fast food restaurants like McDonald's often come under scrutiny for the high calorie and fat content of their menu items. By creating a tool that allows users to easily visualize the nutritional information of McDonald's menu items, it becomes easier for people to make informed decisions about their food choices. Additionally, by including the ability to see how much of the recommended daily value each item fulfills, users can gain a better understanding of how their food choices fit into their overall diet. Overall, the goal of this dashboard app is to empower people to make healthier food choices by providing easy access to nutritional information.
